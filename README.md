Castlemates is a python script which scrapes .pgn files for chess games ending in a checkmates from castling. This project was largely inspired by International Chess Master [Eric Rosen](https://twitter.com/im_rosen?lang=en) and the [Chessfactory Hall Of Fame](https://github.com/mark-dev/chessfactory-hall-of-fame) by Mark-Dev.

## Data
Unfortunately parsing games using the [python chess](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library is quite slow. So `castlemates.py` contains a simplified-lightweight version designed specifically to find games which end in a castle checkmate. My findings scanned over 17 million games on the [Lichess game database](https://database.lichess.org/). Notable players include: [IM Vincent Rothuis](https://lichess.org/qmq5jjLs).

## Executing The Script Yourself
To execute the script `castlemates.py`, you will need to an associated .pgn file which will be passed in as a command line argument. 
```
python castlemates.py example.pgn
```
Optionally, you can set a batch parameter to output a progress message of what game is currently being analyzed. This can give you an idea of how fast the program is running and how many games remain. The following outputs a message every 500 games. 
```
python castlemates.py example.pgn 500
> Progress Update: Game #500
> Progress Update: Game #1,000
```
This parameter by default is set to `1e6`. To disable the progress update messages, set the parameter to `0`.
