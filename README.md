# Castle-Checkmates
A Python script which scrapes pgn files for Chess checkmates from castling. This project was largely inspired by Chess International Master [Eric Rosen](https://twitter.com/im_rosen?lang=en) and the [Chessfactory Hall Of Fame](https://github.com/mark-dev/chessfactory-hall-of-fame) by Mark-Dev.
